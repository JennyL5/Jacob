  <!-- About -->
  <div class="about" id="about">
      <p> Welcome to our website on cooking with your kids. We provide a platform for parents and children to bond over cooking.<br>
      This will also help children understand more about their food consumption, especially with the increase in obesity in recent years. <br>
      With these recipes we hope that children become more confident and creative when cooking, and reduce the amount of junk foods and take-out <br>
      consumed. This will then lead to a healthier and happier lifestyle for them and everyone surrounding them. This also provides an opportunity <br>
      for the parents and children to bond, as well as developing key skills that can be applied in other aspects of their lives. </p>
