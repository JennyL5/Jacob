      <h4> Ingredients </h4>
      <p> You will need: <br> 100g plain flour, <br> 2 large eggs, <br> 300ml milk, <br>1 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil, plus a little extra for frying, <br> lemon wedges (optional)</p>

      <h4> Method: </h4>
      <p>
      1. The child can put 100g plain flour, 2 large eggs, 300ml milk, 1 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil and a pinch of salt into a bowl. <br>
      2. The parent can assist in whisking the mixture to a smooth batter. <br>
      3. Set aside for 30 mins to rest if you have time, or start cooking straight away.<br>
      4. The parent should set a medium frying pan or crêpe pan over a medium heat and carefully wipe it with some oiled kitchen paper. <br>
      5. When hot, cook your pancakes for 1 min on each side until golden, keeping them warm in a low oven as you go. <br>
      6. Serve with lemon wedges and caster sugar, or your favourite filling. <br>
      7. Once cold, you can layer the pancakes between baking parchment, then wrap in cling film and freeze for up to 2 months. </p>
